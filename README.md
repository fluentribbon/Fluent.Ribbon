Visit the [documentation](http://fluentribbon.github.io/documentation/).  
Almost all features are shown in the showcase application.  
The showcase application is included with every release, so you can just grab it from [releases](../../releases)  
If you think there is something missing in the showcase application feel free to create an issue for that.

To be more familiar with the Ribbon concept see [msdn article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/uxguide/cmd-ribbons).

## History &amp; roadmap

## What you can do to help us

- We are accepting pull requests, so you are very welcome to create one
- [Fix some bugs](../../issues)
- Help us translating
- Help us updating the documentation

## Development requirements

- Visual Studio 2019 (16.6) or later (you can it the from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
- .NET core SDK v3.1.300 or later (you can it from https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/Sdk/master/dotnet-sdk-latest-win-x64.exe)

## Designer issues

If you have issues using the designer inside of Visual Studio you can try the following things:

- Clear `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\VisualStudio\[VERSION]\Designer\ShadowCache` or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WDExpress\[VERSION]\Designer\ShadowCache` where `[VERSION]` has to be changed according to your version of Visual Studio
- Clear the `.vs` folder in your development folder

If none of that helps feel free to report an issue here.

## Formatting settings that have to be used

- For general formatting you have to use editorconfig (should work out of the box with Visual Studio 2019)
- XAML
  - Position each attribute on a separate line
    - Position first attribute on same line as start tag
