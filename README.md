## Documentation

Please, [download walkthrough](https://github.com/fluentribbon/Fluent.Ribbon/blob/master/Doc/Fluent%20Ribbon%20Control%20Suite%20Walkthrough.pdf?raw=true)
This document covers the main features of this framework and highlights how to use it, but is pretty outdated right now.
Almost all features are shown in the showcase application. If you think there is something missing in the showcase application feel free to create an issue for that.
