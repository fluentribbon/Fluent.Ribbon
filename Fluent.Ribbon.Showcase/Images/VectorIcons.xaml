    *** How to create XAML vector images

    Probably the best application to create XAML vector images is Microsoft Expression Design. 
    It's a free tool that could be downloaded from http://www.microsoft.com/expression/eng/ 

    When you have installed Expression Design, launch it and select Edit -> Options -> 
    Clipboards (XAML). Change "Clipboard format" to "XAML WPF Resource Dictionary". Also 
    change "Group By" to "Document" (otherwise each layer will be an image).

    Edit your image in Expression Design. When you are done, select everything and open the 
    Edit menu and then "Copy XAML".  Then paste the content into a file like this. Remove the 
    outer ResourceDictionary tag. Change the root tag from DrawingImage to DrawingBrush.

    When you are drawing the image set the document size to the size you want in your WPF-
    application (like 32x32 size). It not necessary but make the work easier. Before copy the 
    image to XAML you probably want to make a transparent rectangle that has the same size as 
    the document (otherwise the margins could be wrong). Or you could add this manually in the 
    drawing group children:

    <GeometryDrawing Brush="#00FFFFFF" Geometry="M 0,0L 32,0L 32,32L 0,32L 0,0 Z " />



    *** If you are using Inkscape

    Inkscape has support to generate XAML-files. However - this is probably not the format you 
    want! WPF has two different ways to handle graphics in XAML - shapes and geometries. You can 
    find more details about this here: http://www.intertech.com/Blog/WPF-Shapes-vs-WPF-Geometries/.
    But in short shapes has support for inputs, while geometries is just pure drawing and therefor
    more lightweight.

    Inkscape generate files in shape-format, which is good for some cases but not for images that 
    should be used in buttons and similar. So what you want is to get your images into Expression 
    Design. You could do that by saving your image as a PDF-file, change the file extension to AI 
    and then in Expression Design use "File", "Import Adobe Illustrator File". Using EPS is another 
    option.

    Most things could be imported to Expression Design. But it might be some issues with borders 
    for instance. When you have got what you want to Expression Design it's probably better to do 
    all the work in there. If needed you could export your images to SVG which could be used in 
    Inkscape, that normally works without any problems.
