## 6.0.0

- ### Breaking changes
  - **[#466](../../issues/466) - StrongName signed assembly? Hey, it's 2017...**  
  **Fluent.Ribbon is no longer a strong-named assembly.**
  - [#433](../../issues/433) - ToggleButton not working correctly when placed in collapsed GroupBox
    `ToggleButton` grouping was done like it's done for a regular `RadioButton`, except that it was bound to visual root scope.  
    The dependency on a visual root scope has been remove, so please adjust the `GroupName` for groups if you have groups with the same name in different visual root scopes.
  - `DropDownButton` (and thus also `SplitButton`) now inherit from `ItemsControl` instead of `MenuBase`.  
    This was changed because `MenuBase` causes a lot of issues regarding keyboard navigation, focus etc..
    This also means that you should use `Fluent:MenuItem` instead of the system provided `MenuItem` as immediate children of `DropDownButton` and `SplitButton`.
  - `SplitButton` now generates two `KeyTip` elements for itself. If you previously used "S" as `KeyTip` there will now be "S1" for the button action and "S2" will open the dropdown.
  - Changes made to `Ribbon`
    - Internal properties for `QuickAccessToolBar` and `TabControl` got converted to `DependencyProperty`
    - Changed order of Children returned from `LogicalChildren`
    - Type of metadata for `Menu` and `StartScreen` changed from `PropertyMetadata` to `FrameworkPropertyMetadata`
  - There are a lot new resources to control the colorization. Please have a look at Colors.xaml for a list of all available resources.  
    This also means that, for example, simply changing the foreground/background of one outer control won't change the foreground/background of all inner controls.
  - [#457](../../issues/457) - Return type of `IKeyTipedControl.OnKeyTipPressed` was changed from `void` to `KeyTipPressedResult`.
  - The following `Color` and `Brush` resources got replaced/renamed/removed:

    This also overrules the fix made for [#415](../../issues/415).
  - [#430](../../issues/430) - No Rezising at Fluent:RibbonContextualTabGroup at Version 5.0
  - [#433](../../issues/433) - ToggleButton not working correctly when placed in collapsed GroupBox

  - [#454](../../issues/454) - RibbonWindow title not shown in correct position when using SizeToContent
  - [#456](../../issues/456) - Maximising a RibbonWindow with MaxWidth or MaxHeight causes an extra border above the title bar
  - [#457](../../issues/457) - Using the keytip shortcut to open a backstage briefly opens it, then closes it immediately
  - [#459](../../issues/459) - Label of the Spinner disappears, if there isn't enough place

- ### Enhancements
  - `LayoutTransform` and `RenderTransform` can now be used directly on `RibbonWindow` as this now gets forwarded to the first template child of the window. Have a look at `TestWindow` in the showcase application for an example on how to use it. This was added as the fix for [#430](../../issues/430).
  - You can change accent and base colors by using `ThemeManager` just like in MahApps.Metro. Please read the [documentation](http://fluentribbon.github.io/documentation/styles) for details.
  - [#275](../../issues/275) - Option for customizing the quick access toolbar access keys  
  `QuickAccessToolBar` now has a property called `UpdateKeyTipsAction` which accepts an instance of `QuickAccessToolBar` through which you can create your own keytips for items in the toolbar.  
  Look at the UnitTest `QuickAccessToolBarTests.TestCustomKeyTips` for a sample.
  - [#313](../../issues/313) - Window state buttons not updating to Windows 10 look / feel
  - [#417](../../issues/417) - Keytips for Splitbuttons  
  You now get 2 KeyTips for `SplitButton`. One for the main action button and one for the dropdown. Those KeyTips get generated by append "A" and "B" to the original `KeyTip`.
  - [#431](../../issues/431) - Changing Ribbon Tab Control Background color and possibly adding Graphic Styling.
  - [#435](../../issues/435) - Add ability to change the Window Title Background the Ribbon Bar is on in order to match the Office 365 Style.
  - [#440](../../issues/440) - Enable changing the height of content area of RibbonTabControl  
  `ContentHeight` is available on `Ribbon` and tranferred to `RibbonTabControl` from there
  - [#443](../../issues/443) - Release .NET 4.6.2 version
  - [#444](../../issues/444) - Add `IgnoreTaskbarOnMaximize` to `RibbonWindow`
  - [#445](../../issues/445) - Startsceen "shines" through backstage
  - [#455](../../issues/455) - Add brushes for checked toggle buttons (thanks @Cubey2019)
  - [#478](../../issues/478) - Custom MinWidth of Start Screen (LeftContent)
  - [#479](../../issues/479) - Bulgarian language (thanks @kalatchev)
  - [#480](../../issues/480) - Disable Scroll Wheel for tab selection  
  You can control this behavior by using `IsMouseWheelScrollingEnabled` on `Ribbon`
  - [#484](../../issues/484) - Add special style/template for MenuItem with set description
  - [#488](../../issues/488) - Display border around content area of RibbonTabControl  
  You can now use `Fluent.Ribbon.Values.RibbonTabControl.Content.BorderThickness` to control the thickness of the border around the content area of `RibbonTabControl`
  - [#494](../../issues/494) - How to align controls such as ToggleButton, Spinner with text  
  You can now opt in to align the headers of controls like `ComboBox` or `Spinner` which are placed in the same column of a `RibbonGroupBox` by adding `Grid.IsSharedSizeScope="True"` to a `RibbonGroupBox`.
  You can opt out of this behavior for single controls in that column by adding `Fluent:RibbonGroupBoxWrapPanel.ExcludeFromSharedSize="True"` to that control.  
  Documentation can be found at http://fluentribbon.github.io/documentation/concepts/sizing#aligningControls
  - [#495](../../issues/495) - Add option disable handling of KeyTips  
  You can now disable handling of all KeyTips by setting `IsKeyTipHandlingEnabled` on `Ribbon` to `False`.
  - [#503](../../issues/503) - Add IsDefinitive property to GalleryItem (thanks @noctis0430)  

## 5.0.2
  - [#437](../../issues/437) - "Could not load ControlzEx"

## 5.0.1
- ### Bug fixes
  - [#412](../../issues/412) - Specific version for nuget references causes issues
  - [#413](../../issues/413) - ColorGallery SelectedColorChanged issue
  - [#415](../../issues/415) - DataContext not forwarded from Ribbon to Backstage (in adorner) and TitleBar

## 5.0.0

- ### Breaking changes
  - Office 2010 and Windows 8 themes got removed. 
    Office 2013 theme was moved from "Themes/Office2013/Generic.xaml" to "Themes/Generic.xaml".
    This was a [community voted decision](../../issues/282).
  - `ComboBox` now uses the default `ItemsPanelTemplate` instead of `VirtualizingStackPanel` again.  
    If you prefer to use `VirtualizingStackPanel` you can change this on a per instance level or add it to your default `Style`.
  - [#301](../../issues/301) - Remove Office 2010 and Windows 8 themes
  - [#302](../../issues/302) - Rename Office 2013 theme to Generic
  - [#309](../../issues/309) - Remove grouping from ComboBox and make GalleryPanel inherit from StackPanel
  - [#310](../../issues/310) - Refactoring of localization
  - [#349](../../issues/349) - Move `RibbonTitleBar` from `Ribbon` to `RibbonWindow`
    - `RibbonWindow` exposes `TitleBar` which is of type `RibbonTitleBar`.  
      `Ribbon` uses the `TitleBar` provided by the `RibbonWindow` by default, through it's `Style`.  
      This allows changing the `TitleBar` being used by the `Ribbon`.
  - Removed `RibbonProperties.TitleBarHeight` to simplify usage of the `Ribbon` in non `RibbonWindow`.  
    To support this the following things were added: 
    - `SelectedContentMargin` was added to `BackstageTabControl`
    - `QuickAccessToolBarHeight` on `Ribbon`
    - `TitleBarHeight` on `RibbonWindow`
  - [#400](../../issues/400) - Default menu / menuitem appearance overridden by FluentRibbon
    - Styles for the following types are no longer overwritten globally `ContextMenu`, `MenuItem`, `MenuItem.SeparatorStyleKey`, `StatusBar`, `StatusBarItem`, `StatusBar.SeparatorStyleKey`
    - `MenuItemStyle` is renamed to `FluentDefaultSystemMenuItemStyle`

  - [#346](../../issues/346) - RibbonWindow icon is blurry (thanks @chdft)
  - [#365](../../issues/365) - BackstageAdorner is not removed
  - [#368](../../issues/368) - Render Glitch when Maximizing RibbonWindow with SizeToContent Enabled 
  - [#369](../../issues/369) - "Restore" button in title bar not displayed correctly when application starts maximized
  - [#377](../../issues/377) - ToggleButton highlight doesn't match the button size
  - [#388](../../issues/388) - QuickAccess item not visible when added from backstage
  - [#391](../../issues/391) - QAT items not displayed properly if tab is made visible after initialization
  - [#392](../../issues/392) - Change Window Title doesn't update Title length
  - [#397](../../issues/397) - Backstage Opening Animation
  - [#398](../../issues/398) - ColorGallery: SelectedColorChanged event raised before SelectedColor changed
  - [#403](../../issues/403) - Tabs can "detach" from ribbon area

- ### Enhancements
  - [#250](../../issues/250) - Enable change/hide of window title foreground
    - `Foreground` of window titel can now be changed by setting `TitleForeground` on `RibbonWindow`.  
    This is bound to `Foreground` of `RibbonWindow`.
  - [#276](../../issues/276) - Custom method for saving and restoring QAT items
  - [#279](../../issues/279) - Localization of ColorGallery
  - [#299](../../issues/299) - Quick access items should show item text as tool tip if no tooltip is set
  - [#324](../../issues/324) - Add "IsSeparatorVisible" to RibbonGroupBox (thanks to @maurosampietro)
  - [#326](../../issues/326) - Add interface for controls which provide LargeIcon
  - [#334](../../issues/334) - Select all text in Spinner on focus

  - [#360](../../issues/360) - Toggling of KeyTips should not happen when Shift is pressed (thanks to @stylefish)
  - [#387](../../issues/387) - Disable/Hide the Menu-DropDown in QuickAccessToolbar
    - `Ribbon` now has `IsQuickAccessToolBarMenuDropDownVisible` and `QuickAccessToolbar` now has `IsMenuDropDownVisible`.
  - Added `CanChangeIsOpen` to `Backstage`
  - Added `ActiveTabBackground` and `ActiveTabBorderBrush` to `RibbonTabItem`
  - Improved interop with windows which are not of type `RibbonWindow`.  
    The showcase contains a sample showcasing working context-tabs in a MahApps.Metro `MetroWindow`.

## 4.0.3

  - Fixes issues with window border on Windows 7 and Windows 8

## 4.0.2

- ### Bug fixes

- ### Notices
  - **As of now the Office 2010 and Windows 8 themes will be removed in version 5.0. You can vote for this at [Future direction of this library](../../issues/282).**

- ### Breaking changes
  - New nuget dependency: [ControlzEx](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ControlzEx). So don't forget to add ControlzEx.dll to your distribution/setup.
  - BorderlessWindowBehavior was replaced by WindowChromeBehavior from [ControlzEx](https://github.com/ControlzEx/ControlzEx).
    This also removes the dependency Microsoft.Windows.Shell as ControlzEx contains everything we need to use WindowChrome.
    This behavior is initialized in code behind (InitializeWindowChromeBehavior) and shows which properties of RibbonWindow can be used to control the behavior.
  - SaveWindowPosition and WindowSettingBehavior were removed [#196](../../issues/196)
  - GlassBorderThickness was renamed to GlassFrameThickness to be consitent with WindowChrome and WindowChromeBehavior [#209](../../issues/209)

## 3.0.0
## Major changes
* Office 2013 theme is now included
* MVVM support got better (yet not complete, please file a bug for things you need to work)
* Samples are not divided anymore (all features shown there are now present in the showcase application)
* All resource reference are now of type "DynamicResource" see comments for changeset https://fluent.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/3572af781b96
* We now use the WindowChrome class provided by Microsoft instead of custom code to render in the non client area
* Large amount of [fixed bugs](https://fluent.codeplex.com/workitem/list/advanced?keyword=&status=Resolved%7cClosed&type=All&priority=All&release=All&assignedTo=All&component=All&reasonClosed=Fixed&sortField=LastUpdatedDate&sortDirection=Descending&page=0)
* Style resources have been improved. That means you now have to include "Themes/Generic.xaml" to get Office 2010 silver and you can just import "Themes/Office2010/Black.xaml" etc. afterwards to get the different colors. To use the Office 2013 theme you can omit "Themes/Generic.xaml" and include "Themes/Office2013/Generic.xaml" instead. You can use RibbonWindow for Office 2010 or Office 2013 themes and you can switch between those at runtime. The showcase application shows how you can do that.

## Breaking changes
* No control in this library sets IsFocusScope=True anymore. This means that ApplicationCommands (such as paste, cut or copy), when bound to a button, don't get enabled when you would expect them to be activated. The showcase application uses those buttons with IsFocusScope=True.
